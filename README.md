### Conceptual Description

For my final project, I extended the very first sketch I made in this class, entitled "momentum." I had already created two iterations of this piece, and in the second, I tried to distill the essence of my message, which is the uncertainty about the future that I am feeling at this point in time. I initially created "momentum" as a representation of what motivates me with the intention of reminding myself to keep moving forward despite the uncertainty. I expanded on this concept in my final project - choosing four other points in time that I have felt this same uncertainty to represent and reflect on and then using my past work as a representation of my current feelings in the final scene of the piece. 

My piece has five scenes. The first four scenes are as follows: 1) Costa Rica in July 2013; 2) Duke in August 2015; 3) Peru in July 2016; and 4) Spain in Spring 2018. I chose these four moments in time because I was feeling uncertain about what was to come before embarking on these experiences. Costa Rica was my first time out of the country, and I was traveling with a group of Girl Scouts from all over the country that I had never met before. I was similarly nervous about moving away from home and going to Duke in August 2015. I didn't know anyone and had chosen to go with a random roommate. In the summer of 2016, I participated in DukeEngage Peru. Although I had been out of the country before, I had never spent a full two months out of the country and I had n

My piece has five scenes. The first scene is a representation of when I traveled to Costa Rica in July 2013. This was my first time out of the country, and I represent the most important elements of my experience in an abstract way, using clipart pop-ups. When users hover over the three ellipses at the bottom of the screen, they find a group of people holding hands in a circle, a passport, and a representation of the Costa Rican flag. The image of the people holding hands represents the new relationships I formed and the passport represents that it was my first time out of the country. The background is a picture that I took with a filter on it. I chose this particular filter because, given the fact that this piece is deeply personal, I wanted to abstract some of personal aspects to some extent so I feel comfortable with other users engaging with my piece. The filter is consistent in the next three scenes.
